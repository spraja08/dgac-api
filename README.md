Domain Driven Design (DDD) and Microservices have
fundamentally changed the way we develop software in the last
decade. The Data in the analytics department is fast catching up
with that also. As software architectures have moved from
monolithic to microservices, the data platforms are also moving
away from being centralized monoliths to domain-oriented,
decentralized data spaces. This decentralization is critical to
eliminate the failure modes in the current centralized data
platform implementations (2). Further to that, each of these
autonomous data environments will also use one or more
purpose built, best-fit datastores (3) (event brokers, relational
systems, object stores, graph databases etc.) to persist and
expose their data products.

This decentralization, together with the polyglot and hybrid-
cloud characteristics of the modern data environments have led
to some challenging consequences to the field of data
governance. As the adoption of this new paradigm accelerates
(4), there is a critical pressure for reinventing a data governance
solution that works at this scale and complexity, but without
compromising the organizationsâ€™ agility in producing and
democratizing data. 

This repo contains a core idea of how to address the data governace at scale challenge.
